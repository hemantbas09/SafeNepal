# SAFE-Nepal

In an ever-changing world where environmental concerns and sustainable practices have become paramount, the Students' Association for Forest and Environment (SAFE-Nepal) recognized the need to enhance their outreach and impact. This community responsibility project aimed to address this challenge by developing a static website for SAFE-Nepal, the Green Organization of the Institute of Forestry in Pokhara, Nepal. The website serves as a digital gateway to promote environmental conservation, sustainable forest management, and ecological awareness among the masses.
